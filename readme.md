## Wolfpack Howl
Wolfpack Howl is an app created for Don Bosco Cristo Rey High School and Corporate Work Study Program alumni. 

## Motivation
As the Don Bosco Cristo Rey Alumni Outreach Coordinator, I wanted to create an app that allows the Alumni Outreach Coordinator to more easily curate events, news, programs, and articles relevant to DBCR alumni. Additionally, I wanted to make it easier for alumni to submit transcript requests and life updates directly to the Alumni Outreach Coordinator.
